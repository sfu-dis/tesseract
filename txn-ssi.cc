  // tzwang: The race between the updater (if any) and me (as the reader) -
  // A reader publishes its existence by calling serial_register_reader().
  // The updater might not notice this if it already checked this tuple
  // before the reader published its existence. In this case, the writer
  // actually thinks nobody is reading the version that's being overwritten.
  // So as the reader, we need to make sure we know the existence of the
  // updater during precommit. We do this by checking the tuple's sstamp
  // (and it's basically how this parallel pre-commit works).
  //
  // Side note: this "writer-oversights-reader" problem pertains to only
  // SSI, because it needs to track "concurrent reads" or some read that
  // belongs to an evil T1 (assuming I'm the unlucky T2), while for SSN
  // it doesn't matter - SSN only cares about things got committed before,
  // and the reader that registers after writer entered precommit will
  // definitely precommit after the writer.
  //
  // Reader's protocol:
  // 1. If sstamp is not set: no updater yet, but if later an updater comes,
  //    it will enter precommit after me (if it can survive). So by the time
  //    the updater started to look at the readers bitmap, if I'm still in
  //    precommit, I need to make sure it sees me on the bitmap (trivial, as
  //    I won't change any bitmaps after enter precommit); or if I committed,
  //    I need to make sure it sees my updated xstamp. This essentially means
  //    the reader shouldn't deregister from the bitmap before setting xstamp.
  //
  // 2. If sstamp is ASI_LOG: the easy case, updater already committed, do
  //    usually SSI checks.
  //
  // 3. If sstamp is ASI_XID: the most complicated case, updater still active.
  //    a) If the updater has a cstamp < my cstamp: it will commit before
  //       me, so reader should spin on it and find out the final sstamp
  //       result, then do usual SSI checks.
  //
  //    b) If the updater has a cstamp > my cstamp: the writer entered
  //       precommit after I did, so it definitely knows my existence -
  //       b/c when it entered precommit, I won't change any bitmap's
  //       bits (b/c I'm already in precommit). The updater should check
  //       the reader's cstamp (which will be the version's xstamp), i.e.,
  //       the updater will spin if if finds the reader is in pre-commit;
  //       otherwise it will read the xstamp directly from the version.
  //
  //    c) If the updater doesn't have a cstamp: similar to 1 above),
  //       it will know about my existence after entered precommit. The
  //       rest is the same - reader has the responsibility to make sure
  //       xstamp or bitmap reflect its visibility.
  //
  //    d) If the updater has a cstamp < my cstamp: I need to spin until
  //       the updater has left to hold my position in the bitmap, so
  //       that the updater can know that I'm a concurrent reader. This
  //       can be done in post-commit, right before I have to pull myself
  //       out from the bitmap.
  //
  //  The writer then doesn't have much burden, it just needs to take a look
  //  at the readers bitmap and abort if any reader is still active or any
  //  xstamp > ct3; overwritten versions' xstamp are guaranteed to be valid
  //  because the reader won't remove itself from the bitmap unless it updated
  //  v.xstamp.
