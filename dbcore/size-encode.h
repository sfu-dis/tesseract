/*
  Encode a non-negative size in 8 bits, using a format similar to
  floating point. As with a floating point representation, precision
  decreases as the magnitude increases. Also as with floating point,
  the encoding is order-preserving and codes can be compared directly.

  The encoding can represent values ranging from 0 (0x00) to 950272
  (0xfe); 0xff is reserved as NaN/invalid. To avoid clipping objects,
  the input is always rounded up to the next representable value
  before encoding it, with a maximum rounding error of 6.25%.

  Notably, the encoding represents nearly all k*2**i <= 928k exactly,
  for integer 0 < k < 32 and integer 0 <= i < 20. The only exceptions
  are: 25*2 (52), 27*2 (56), 29*2 (60), 31*2 (64), 29*4 (120), 31*4
  (128), 31*8 (256). It also represents several other "interesting" k
  exactly because those k often contain powers of two. For example
  100*2**i = 25*2**(i+2) is always exact.

  Encoding is somewhat expensive (in no small part due to the
  requirement that we round up), but decoding is quite fast, requiring
  only 13 machine instructions (one branch) on x86_64

   approximate the allocation may be slightly larger than the object
   that occupies it. If this matters, the user (or the object) is
   responsible to track the object's true size in some other way.
