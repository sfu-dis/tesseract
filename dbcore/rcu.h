/***
    A lightweight user-space RCU implementation.

    RCU (read-copy-update) is a resource management scheme designed to
    simplify some concurrency control problems significantly. In
    particular, it solves the "dangling pointer" problem, where a
    writer wishes to change or delete some object that readers might
    be in the middle of using. The RCU protocol generally forbids
    in-place updates, and instead requires that writers install a
    modified copy of an object while leaving the original usable in
    case readers are using it. Once a new version is installed, the
    old version becomes unreachable (to new readers) and will
    eventually become unreferenced (by current readers) as well. The
    system can then reclaim any object that it can prove is both
    unreachable and unreferenced.

    RCU makes no attempt to protect writers from other writers; these
    should synchronize using a suitable concurrency control mechanism
    (locking, atomic ops, lock-free algorithms, etc.).

    Readers access RCU-protected state in "transactions." An RCU
    transaction begins when the reader announces its intention to
    access RCU-protected resources and ends when the reader announces
    that it has finished. These announcements can be quite
    coarse-grained: the system is primarily concerned with knowing
    which threads are "busy" vs. "idle" more than which are "inside"
    or "outside" a particular critical section. Threads with long gaps
    between idle periods (or which never become idle) can also
    announce "quiescent" points any time they hold no references to
    RCU-protected resources. Quiescent points are extremely
    lightweight, and have virtually no overhead unless the calling
    thread's transaction is delaying a garbage collection cycle; even
    in the latter case, the overhead is no worse than ending the
    transaction and beginning a new one.

    Note that RCU "transactions" have nothing to do with application
    semantics, but rather identify contiguous spans of time where
    garbage collection is unsafe because the reader might hold
    references to unreachable objects. Thus, a "transaction" can end
    any time the reader holds no RCU references, even if the reader's
    current operation is far from complete.

    This implementation is based on a notion of "safe points." At the
    moment one safe point is installed, there exists some set of
    in-flight RCU transactions (called "stragglers") who might still
    hold references to objects that became unreachable before the safe
    point. Those objects cannot be reclaimed until all stragglers end,
    at which point a new safe point can be installed and the cycle
    repeats. The tricky part is identifying stragglers in scalable
    fashion and with low overhead, which we achieve by ensuring that
    threads can easily identify if they are stragglers, and if so,
    whether they are the last straggler; in most cases the thread can
    determine this by a simple lookup in thread-local storage.
 */

/* Instruct the RCU runtime to reclaim resources whenever the number
   of unreachable objects is more than [nobj] or the number of
   unreachable bytes is more than [nbytes]. In general, these numbers
   should be large enough that most RCU transactions do not become
   stragglers.
