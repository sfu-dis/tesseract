/*
 * tzwang(20161103): Memory allocation, deallocation, and garbage collection:
 *
 * The engine reserves large chunks of hugepages from the OS upon
 * initialization for each socket. Each thread maintains a local pool of free
 * memory got from the corresponding socket's reserved memory and serves
 * requests using this TLS pool (bump allocator). All memory allocations are
 * rounded up to a certain alignment size. Deallocated objects are stored in
 * thread-local free object pools for reuse. During each succeeded update
 * operation, the underlying thread will traverse the updated version chain to
 * try garbage collecting versions that are no needed any more (decided by the
 * epoch manager). Objects GC'ed from version chains will be put again to the
 * TLS free objects pool. It is the update threads that traverse the chain and
 * recycle stale versions because an update means we're potentially making
 * older versions stale and becoming candidates of GC.
 *
 * The TLS free object pool is a hash table indexed by aligned object sizes.
 * Objects of the same size will be put into the same set (std::unordered_set).
 *
 * Upon allocation, if the TLS object pool is non-empty, the thread will try to
 * find an object of the requested size in this pool, instead of the TLS bump
 * allocator.  If the free object pool is empty, we continue with the bump
 * allocator; if the bump allocator also doesn't have free memory, we ask the
 * central per-socket reserved memory pool; if we still don't get any free
 * memory, the allocation fails.
 *
 * In this way, GC time is amortized in updates, saving extra costs for
 * maintaining the set of updated OIDs and extra thread resources for the GC
 * thread.
 *
 * Note: the epoch advancing speed must be fast enough, so that whenever a
 * thread is GC-ing a version chain, it doesn't need to traverse too deep into
 * the chain.  If the epoch advances too slowly, i.e., it's possible then
 * during an epoch a tuple is updated many times - very long chain - and yet
 * the thread still cannot GC the versions because they belong to the same,
 * relatively still new epoch. This will waste cycles and delay memory
 * reclaimation as we're traversing a long chain but are not able to recycle
 * much.
