/* An allocator has (essentially) two jobs, one trivial, and one
   difficult. The easy job is allocating never-before-used objects,
   which can be done using a simple bump allocator. The hard job is
   recycling previously-freed objects, made difficult because we have
   to *find* those previously-freed objects in order to reuse them
   (which implies a need to efficiently track which ones have been
   freed, also a non-trivial task).

   We have here a multi-level allocator that attempts to strike a
   reasonable balance of time and space overheads versus precision
   (ability to recycle previously-freed objects).

   L0 is the bump allocator. It comprises a simple high water mark
   (identifying the highest OID ever allocated) and a capacity mark,
   that indicates how far bump allocation is allowed to proceed before
   the system attempts to reclaim freed OIDs (more on that later).

   L1 captures recently-freed OIDs. It is an array-based stack with
   several thousand entries, where OIDs are pushed on free and popped
   on allocate; the system will always drain L1 before bumping L0, and
   drains half of L1 to L2 each time L1 overflows.

   L2 serves to collect clusters of recently freed OIDs as they
   trickle in from L1. It uses sparse bitsets that can hold up to 16
   OIDs from a 64k-element swaths of the OID space. Swaths are
   assigned bitsets only if they contain at least one OID, and "full"
   bitsets (containing 16 OIDs) are retired to a list that will be
   drained after L1 is empty (and before bumping L0). Depending on the
   workload, L2 capacity ranges between 64k and 1M OIDs, usually with
   a small fraction of those OIDs available for easy re-allocation. L2
   is sized such there is one physical bitset for each swath of the
   OID space, so overflow can only occur if there are at least two
   full bitsets. By definition, L1 must also be full when L2
   overflows, so inconvenient bitsets drain to L3, one at a time, on
   overflow (see policy below). If L1 and L2 are both empty, the
   implementation prefers to scavenge non-full bitsets from L2
   (placing their OIDs into L1) if doing so would fill a significant
   fraction of L1. Otherwise, it prefers to bump L0.

   L3 is the lowest level of the allocator and captures all worst-case
   scenarios that defeat the higher levels. It is a dense bitmap, with
   one bit for every OID. Because the full bitmap is enormous (512MB),
   L3 starts out as small as possible and grows only if it needs to
   set a bit past the current end-of-storage. To minimize L3 growth,
   we prefer to spill non-full L2 entries that would fit in the
   existing L3 storage space. Failing that, we prefer to spill full L2
   entries that fit in the existing L3. Failing that, we spill
   remaining full L2 entries (at which point L2 is guaranteed to no
   longer be full and we stop).

   Although L1 and L2 should usually be effective at recycling most
   OIDs that are freed, a bad case could result in L1 and L2 both
   underflowing (even after scavenging L2) *and* the bump allocator
   being at capacity. At this point, we have two choices (assuming the
   allocator is not yet full-sized): scavenge L3 or increase the
   allocator's size (thus allowing bump allocation again). To prevent
   the allocator growing endlessly, we impose the policy that the
   allocator is only allowed to grow if doing so would make available
   fewer OIDs than could be reclaimed by scavenging L3. Since growing
   the allocator too much at a time would increase the risk of further
   overflows *and* L3 growth, we prefer to increase allocator size by
   small increments (e.g. 25%), which in turn would require us to
   scavenge L3 if more than 25% of all OIDs reside there. Note that,
   where sizes traditionally grow by doubling (increments of 100%),
   growing by increments of 25% is still geometric growth, and so
   allocation cost remains limited to amortized constant time.

   WARNING: this implementation does *not* deal with concurrency
   control at all, nor does it attempt to resize itself as the
   allocator grows. The user of this class is expected to deal with
   those issues, though the allocator provides helper functions to
   simplify resizing (CC should be as simple as grabbing a mutex).
